/**
 * Regression test for #3811: relative imports in scripts that ship via the
 * Railway nixpacks build with `root_dir=scripts` MUST NOT escape `scripts/`,
 * because nixpacks packages only `scripts/` contents into `/app/` in the
 * container. An `import '../server/_shared/X.mjs'` resolves to
 * `/server/_shared/X.mjs` at runtime — a path that doesn't exist — and
 * crashes the worker on startup with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
 *
 * Three Railway services are affected:
 *   - seed-forecasts        — node scripts/seed-forecasts.mjs
 *   - simulation-worker     — node scripts/process-simulation-tasks.mjs
 *   - deep-forecast-worker  — node scripts/process-deep-forecast-tasks.mjs
 *
 * (See docs/railway-seed-consolidation-runbook.md for the service list and
 * Dockerfile.digest-notifications header for the cherry-pick alternative
 * we explicitly do NOT use for these three.)
 *
 * Approach: BFS from each entry script, follow relative imports, assert no
 * resolved path escapes `scripts/`. Skips bare-package and `node:*` imports.
 *
 * Companion to the header comment in
 * `scripts/_simulation-queue-constants.mjs`.
